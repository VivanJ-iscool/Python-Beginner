#CLASSWORK QUESTIONS:
#1:
#A name error is when you try to either print a variable but you print the variable you wrote in quotes or you do the oposite
#A type error is when you try to use operators with strings, floats or integers and it either works in a word lenght way or just says that it's a type error
#A Syntax error is when you either miss a bracket, a quotation mark or use two different quotation marks
#An indentation error is when you miss an indentation or add an extra indentation where not needed
#A logic error is when you yourself makes a mistake which you didn't want to happen but there is no pop-up-error.
